# MQC Header Compression

## Scenario

You work for a large provider in India as a senior network engineer specialized in Quality of Service. You have a number of slow serial links connected to routers with a low CPU usage. You decide to implement header compression so you can squeeze the most out of your network.

## Goal

* All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
* Configure RTP compression on router Prio for all RTP packets.
* Configure TCP compression on router Line for all TELNET packets.

## GNS3 2.2.56.1

Import [MQCHeaderCompression IOU.gns3project](MQCHeaderCompression%20IOU.gns3project) using **File > Import portable project**. To open `MQCHeaderCompression.gns3` directly, keep it beside `project-files`.

IOU L3 routers use `x86_64_crb_linux-adventerprisek9-ms.bin`, 768 MB RAM, **512 KB NVRAM**, four Ethernet and four serial adapters. CLI switches use the preferred IOU L2 image `i86bi-linux-l2-adventerprisek9-15.2d.bin`, 256 MB RAM, **512 KB NVRAM**, four Ethernet adapters and no serial adapters. Images, checksums, templates and shared settings follow `AGENTS.md`; consoles allocate automatically. Startup configs are bundled under `project-files/iou/<node-id>/startup-config.cfg`.

Unmanaged Ethernet and built-in Frame Relay switches retain their device types and VLAN/PVC settings. Connected IOU interfaces use ANSI LMI for the built-in Frame Relay switch.

Startup and supplied final configurations use the interface mappings below. Effective bandwidth, delay, administrative state and routing/policy command contexts were compared against their source. Obsolete hardware-only commands are removed. Ports omitted to fit the selected model are unused hardware-only ports, listed in the verification notes.

| Device | Source interface | Current interface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frank | FastEthernet0/0 | Ethernet0/0 |
| Jack | FastEthernet0/0 | Ethernet0/0 |
| Line | FastEthernet1/0 | Ethernet0/0 |
| Line | Serial0/0 | Serial4/0 |
| Line | Serial0/1 | Serial4/1 |
| Line | Serial0/2 | Serial4/2 |
| Line | Serial0/3 | Serial4/3 |
| Prio | FastEthernet1/0 | Ethernet0/0 |
| Prio | Serial0/0 | Serial4/0 |
| Prio | Serial0/1 | Serial4/1 |
| Prio | Serial0/2 | Serial4/2 |
| Prio | Serial0/3 | Serial4/3 |

See [verification, reconstruction and source limitations](VERIFICATION.md). Portable archives contain the initial state and supplied solution files separately; final configs are not loaded at startup. Original `.net` files and diagrams are reference material. Containerlab artifacts are unchanged.
