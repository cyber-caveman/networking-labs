# ospf-over-frame-relay: conversion verification

Reviewed on 2026-10-10 for GNS3 **2.2.56.1** against the pre-conversion working-tree files. **Configuration analysis only; no devices were booted.**

## Project and startup checks

- 3 IOU devices (0 CLI switches), 1 Dynamips routers, 0 unmanaged Ethernet switches, 0 built-in Frame Relay switches and 0 clouds.
- All IOU image/checksum/template, RAM/NVRAM, adapter and common settings match `AGENTS.md`; NVRAM is 512 KB.
- Project and device properties pass the installed GNS3 schemas. Every link endpoint exists in GNS3’s actual port factory and connects compatible media. IDs are unique and console ports automatic.
- Link peers and interface identities match the source topology after conversion, except for the explicit source reconstructions below. VLAN/PVC mappings are preserved.
- Bundled startup configs match the loose startup files. The portable archive passes ZIP integrity checks and matches the project/config files.

## Supplied solution comparison

All **0 supplied final config files**, including any backup variants, were associated with a device and compared in command context. The comparison checks addressing and interface references, routing processes and metrics, authentication, ordered ACLs/route maps, service configuration and lab-specific policy statements. Physical-interface bandwidth/delay and administrative state were compared separately. Hardware-only removals and the documented default/transport adjustments are the only allowed differences.

This establishes preservation of the supplied configuration, subject to target-image support/defaults. It does not establish that a source solution is complete or correct, or that a reconstructed startup is identical to a missing original. Duplicate/conflicting source commands and solution variants have not been silently repaired.

## Source notes and reconstruction

Missing topology reconstructed from the supplied Frame Relay diagram; existing startup configs retained.

FRSW: Frame Relay switching router retained as Dynamips using the available C3640 appliance; config and interface names preserved.

No completed final configs were supplied; none were invented.

## Live behavior not verified

Original switch roles and PVC mappings are preserved. Built-in switches use ANSI LMI on connected IOU interfaces. Check LMI, DLCIs, PVC state, encapsulation, neighbors and forwarding live.

All platform-specific CLI acceptance, protocol state and packet forwarding are unverified. Start with `show ip interface brief`, the relevant neighbor/session and routing-table commands, then the exercise-specific verification commands and pings.
